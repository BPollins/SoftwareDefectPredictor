# Software Defect Predictor Challenge - Kaggle Playground Series - Season 3 Episode 23

#### Purpose
This is a Kaggle challenge, the goal of which is to create a model to predict whether a piece of software will have a defect depending on the features of the software.

#### Progress
The project has been completed with the following steps:
- Importing of dataset from Kaggle
- Investigation + visualisation of raw data
- Missing value handling
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering + selection
- Model selection
- Model hyper-parameter tuning
- Predictions made and evaluated

#### Future Work
- Continue model improvement
- Experiment with more algorithms inc. XGBoost

The data was obtained from Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s3e23/data

#### System Requirements
This program is created using:
- conda 23.1.0
- jupyter 1.0.0
- jupyterlab 3.4.4
